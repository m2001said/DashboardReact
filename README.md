# Dashboard with Reactjs & Tailwind & Syncfusion

## [Live Demo](https://m2001said.github.io/DashboardReact)

### This is a great tutorail from Javascript Mastery on youtube

This is an awesome Project : at the while you see the project , you think that the code is very huge and this is what i think at the first time also ,but with :

- Syncfusion , you can build any component with little than 10 lines of code . you will import it and put the services which you want in it depends on the documentation .
- tailwind , it is very easy to make a lot of classes and without doing media queriers and every screen which you should see and fix width and height .Actually you will need to install (Tailwind CSS IntelliSense) extension in VSCode to make it easy for you to see the properties for every class you will write.
